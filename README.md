# A fortune(6) implementation in Rust

This is mainly a project I'm using to learn Rust, so there might be
a few odd constructs and not-quite-there snippets of code â€” these
will be improved once we get a better feel of the ground we're
running on. Or not, who knows.

That said, this version should have (approximately) the same options
you'll find in fortune-mod as distributed in Ubuntu 17.10 or Fedora
27, which is probably old and definitely buggy. I tried to not replicate
the bugs.
